# **YOLOv9-Based Weed Detection for Sustainable Agriculture**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of a **semi-supervised deep learning model** for weed detection in precision agriculture using **YOLOv9**. The model leverages **semi-supervised learning** to improve detection accuracy while reducing the dependency on labeled data. It utilizes **Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) loss** and **F1 score optimization** for enhanced object detection.

This work is part of a **competition submission**, demonstrating advanced deep learning techniques for **real-time weed detection** in agricultural settings.

## **Requirements**
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision albumentations numpy opencv-python matplotlib tqdm ultralytics
```

**Key Libraries Used:**
- `PyTorch` – Deep learning framework for training the YOLOv9 model.

- `OpenCV` – Image processing and transformation.
- `NumPy` – Numerical computations.
- `Matplotlib` – Visualization of predictions and model performance.

## **Dataset & Preprocessing** 
The dataset consists of:
- **200 labeled images** (annotated with crops and weeds).
- **1,000 unlabeled images** (used for semi-supervised training).

### **Data Augmentation**
To enhance the model’s robustness, data augmentation was applied using **Albumentations**:
- **RandomBrightnessContrast**
- **HueSaturationValue**
- **RandomFog, RandomRain, RandomSnow**
- **MotionBlur, GaussianBlur, GaussianNoise**
- **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)**
- **GridDistortion**

Each image was augmented **5 times** to simulate real-world field conditions.

## **Model Architecture: YOLOv9**
We utilize **YOLOv9**, an advanced version of YOLO (You Only Look Once), for real-time object detection.

### **Key Improvements in YOLOv9:**
- **Better localization accuracy** using **GIoU loss**.
- **Improved feature extraction** for small object detection.
- **Optimized training with F1-score-based loss function.**

### **Semi-Supervised Learning Approach**
1. **Initial Training**: The YOLOv9 model is trained using **200 labeled images**.
2. **Pseudo-Labeling**: The trained model predicts labels for **1,000 unlabeled images**.
3. **Confidence-Based Selection**: The top **200 high-confidence pseudo-labeled images** (confidence ≥ 0.5) are added to the dataset.
4. **Iterative Training**: The model is retrained using the expanded dataset.

## **Loss Functions & Optimization**
### **1. F1 Score Loss**
Used for optimizing the trade-off between **precision** and **recall**:

```
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall + 1e-8)
```

This ensures that both false positives and false negatives are minimized.

### **2. Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) Loss**
An improved IoU-based metric for better bounding box alignment:

```
L_GIoU = 1 - (IoU - |C - (A ∪ B)| / |C|)
```

Where:
- `A` = predicted bounding box
- `B` = ground truth bounding box
- `C` = smallest enclosing convex shape

Using **GIoU loss** helps the model better localize weeds under complex environmental conditions.

---

## **Confidence Thresholding**
The model's predictions are filtered using a **confidence threshold**:

```
Confidence = Objectness * Class Probability
```

Only predictions with a confidence score ≥ **0.5** are considered for pseudo-labeling.
